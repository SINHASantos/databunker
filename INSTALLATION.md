# Installing Databunker

## Just run from the Docker container

This is the easiest method to start with Data Bunker. Always use the latest version.

You can fetch and start Databunker with the following command:

```
cd ~
mkdir -p data
docker run -v ~/data:/databunker/data -p 3000:3000 \
  --rm --name dbunker paranoidguy/databunker
```

This command will init Databunker service, init database and start container.

This command will print **DATABUNKER_MASTERKEY** and **DATABUNKER_ROOTTOKEN**.

The database will be init in the /tmp/data parent directory.

**DATABUNKER_MASTERKEY** is used to encrypt database records.

**DATABUNKER_ROOTTOKEN** is an access token to databunker API.


## Stop service

To stop Databunker container you can run the following command:

```
docker kill dbunker
```

# Run it again

You can run it again, after it was initalized. Use the following command:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /tmp/data:/databunker/data \
  -e "DATABUNKER_MASTERKEY=**DATABUNKER_MASTERKEY**" \
  --rm --name dbunker paranoidguy/databunker
```

# SSL certificates

You can generate SSL certificates and place them in the /databunker/certs directory in the running container.

For example you can do this by mounting **/databunker/certs** to a local **~/certs/** directory as:

```
cd ~
mkdir -p certs
# generate certificates, check bellow
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v ~/data:/databunker/data \
  -v ~/certs:/databunker/certs \
  -e "DATABUNKER_MASTERKEY=**DATABUNKER_MASTERKEY**" \
  --rm --name dbunker paranoidguy/databunker

```

So, you need to prepare server.crt and server.key files.

## Generate self-signed certificates

You can do the following command to generate one:

```
cd ~
mkdir -p certs
cd certs
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509 \
    -subj "/C=UK/ST=/L=London/O=Your-company Ltd./CN=databunker.your-company.com" \
    -keyout server.key -out server.crt
```

## Use certificates generated by letsencrypt

Copy letsencrypt file **privkey.pem** to ~/certs/server.key

Copy letsencrypt file **fullchain.pem** file to ~/certs/server.crt


# Create a test record

You can download and run a small test script that will create a user record, user app record, user consent, etc...

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paranoidguy/databunker/master/create-test-user.sh -o test.sh
chmod 755 ./test.sh
./test.sh **DATABUNKER_MASTERKEY**
```
